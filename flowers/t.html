<h3>Scientific Name: Chelone</h3>
<h3>Information:</h3>
<div>[1] Turtlehead plants prefer moist soil in a location with filtered sun, but they also have a good tolerance for shady conditions. One thing they do not like, however, is dry soil. In bright sun, a layer of leaf mulch will help keep the soil cool and moist. When planted in a shady area, they may require staking to prevent them from flopping over, though this is rarely necessary in sunnier locations. As a woodland flower, turtlehead does best in partial shadeâ€”the setting is most similar to its natural environment, where it typically grows in the filtered light beneath a canopy of trees. However, the plant can grow in full sun as well, as long as its soil is kept continually moist. Pink turtlehead is considered the most tolerant varietal of bright sun. Turtlehead plants prefer moist, organically rich soil, with a slightly acidic soil pH level between 5.0 and 6.8. Keep your turtlehead plants continually moist while the plants set root and throughout their growing and blooming season. As a general rule of thumb, turtlehead grows best when it gets regular water, and it is especially important during the first year as the plants establish themselves. The less water stress they suffer, the more they will thrive. These plants prefer mild, moist conditions and will not do well in hot, arid climates. In warm climates, give the plants some shade and mulch the ground with a thick layer of leaf mulch or another organic material. Don't feed your turtlehead plants during their first year of growth. After that, a yearly spring feeding with a balanced liquid fertilizer is recommended to encourage blooms.</div>
<h3>Dan's Notes</h3>
<div>This flower's name, Cherone, is derived from Greek meaning "turtle-like", in reference to its turtle head shaped corollas. The most likely east coast variant is Chelone obliqua, with obliqua being Greek for slanting or oblique. It is cultivated as an ornamental plant, and is threatened and endangered in some states. Curiously, the only state in the Atlantic area that is not listed as having this flower is Pennsylvania, but seeing as the states surrounding Pennsylvania are on the list, it can probably be found there as well.</div>
