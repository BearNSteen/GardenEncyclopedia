<h3>Scientific Name: Vernonia noveboracensis</h3>
<h3>Information:</h3>
<div>[1] Sow the seeds in the fall, planting them no deeper than 1/8th of an inch in the soil. They'll begin to germinate sometime in the spring. If you want your Ironweed to develop additional resistance against cold, winter weather, sow your seeds in a pot. Again, be sure to plant them no deeper than 1/8th of an inch. Then, when the seedlings are two to three inches tall, move them to your garden. If you prefer to sow your seeds indoors, you can do so by utilizing your refrigerator. Plant your Ironweed seeds in flats, cover them with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for about three months. When the seedlings reach at least two inches, they can be transplanted into your garden. Ironweeds are large plants, so space your seeds at least 12 inches apart, no matter your method. New York Ironweed plants prefer full sun, but can thrive in partial sun, too. Aim for six hours of direct sunlight or two to six hours of direct sunlight if your garden is partially shaded. If you live in a colder climate, consider planting your Ironweed in a very sunny spot with little to no wind. Ironweeds are hardy plants, so they can adapt to many different kinds of soil. Although naturally-occurring Ironweed fares better in very moist soil, Ironweeds planted in a garden can typically survive in acidic, neutral, or alkaline soil that's dry, chalky, sandy, or high in clay. Because Ironweeds prefer medium-to-moist soil, their watering needs range from average to high. Well-draining soil or pots are ideal, but Ironweeds can tolerate low drainage, too. The native area for New York Ironweed is massive, ranging from New Hampshire to Florida. Accordingly, it's a very hardy plant in terms of heat and humidity. The Ironweed grows in zones 5 (with the last frost in mid-May and the first frost in late September to early October) through zone 9 (with the final frost around the beginning of March and the first frost in mid-December). New York Ironweed should be divided every three to four years to keep the plant healthy. To do so, carefully cut away dead parts of the crown and roots with a very sharp knife. Then, cut the leftover crowns and roots into pieces for replanting. When you replant them, be sure to leave at least 12 inches of space between each cutting.</div>
<h3>Dan's Notes</h3>
<div>This plant is in the daisy family and is native to the eastern United States. Native Americans used ironweed for medicinal purposes, mostly to cure "female problems", like childbirth pain, and a "blood tonic". I'm not sure what that is, exactly, but it sounds dangerous. Root teas were used to treat loose teeth, stomach ulcers, and hemorrhaging. It sounds like it was useful for a number of things, but I would worry about that whole blood tonic thing.Update: I have looked up what a blood tonic is, and supposedly it's something that helps your blood, not something that is made out of your blood. So never mind, drink at your leisure.</div>
