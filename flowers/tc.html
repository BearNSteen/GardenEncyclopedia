<h3>Scientific Name: Coreopsis tripteris</h3>
<h3>Information:</h3>
<div>[1] This is a hardy plant that is easy to grow and care for. It is unfussy, long-lived, and stays in bloom for extended periods. The following are the optimal conditions it needs. Coreopsis tripteris is a true sun lover. It enjoys full sun and partial shade, so look for a sunny spot to grow it in your garden. It is sturdy and heat-tolerant with USDA Hardiness Zones 4 -9. Tall coreopsis is drought tolerant. It has very low watering needs, especially during the colder months of the year. You can water it regularly during the bloom time but refrain from overwatering as it can lead to waterlogged soil. This is a hardy plant that thrives well in rocky or sandy soil of poor to medium quality. The soil must be well-drained but the soil moisture must remain consistent. This is because plants grown in soil with consistent moisture tend to grow fuller and taller as compared to plants that are grown in dry soil. This plant does not require fertilizer for growing or blooming. It grows and flourishes well in poor soil. In the right growing conditions, this plant can naturalize to form large colonies as it self-seeds abundantly. If you plant it in a pot or borders, plant division will be required every 1-2 years. This plant generally propagates through seeds. It self-seeds vigorously, which makes it the perfect plant for naturalization. Mature plants can also be propagated through division. Simply dig up the mature plants, divide the stems, and replant them. Pruning is good as it encourages additional bloom. Deadhead old flowers before or after the flowering season to enjoy the full bloom. It is also a great way to avoid surplus self-seeding and restricting the spread of tall coreopsis in your garden. The best time for trimming your plants is in late April. This will also help in maintaining the desired height of the plant.</div>
<h3>Dan's Notes</h3>
<div>This plant is in the aster family, like a few other plants in this encyclopedia. It can be found anywhere between Ontario, Canada, Texas, and the Florida panhandle, so it can be found in a lot of places. All of my sources were screaming at me about how much it loves the sun, so I would say this plant really loves the sun. Despite that, it grows best in a moist habitat, along steambanks and in wet meadows. It is a popularly available ornamental plant.</div>
