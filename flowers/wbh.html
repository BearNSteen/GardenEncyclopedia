<h1>Wild Bleeding Heart</h1><br>
<img src="pics\wbh.png" width="200" height="200"></img><br>
<h3>Scientific Name: Dicentra</h3>
<h3>Information:</h3>
<div>[1] Wild Bleeding Heart grows in zones 3 to 9, and prefers shade and part shade, in rich, moist, well-drained soil.  It will tolerate more sun if kept moist. Once established, this Bleeding Heart will tolerate occasional periods of drought, and does not like wet, winter soil. It is best to divide this plant every few years in early spring.  You can also find transplants around the plant from seeds dropping.  Like many native wildflowers, the seeds are covered with sticky elaiosome that attracts ants.  When the ants take the seeds to their nests, they distribute the seeds around the garden. Wild Bleeding Hearts can be bothered by slugs, aphids, downy mildew, rust and other fungal diseases especially if not planted in ideal conditions.</div>
<h3>Dan's Notes</h3>
<div>Stay away from this one! All parts of the flower are poison if injested! You have been warned. There are two variants that are common to the eastern United States, Dicentra canadensis, or squirrel-corn, and Dicentra cucullaria, or Dutchman's-breeches. Native Americans considered this plant useful for syphilis, skin conditions, and as a blood purifier. It contains several alkaloids that may have affects on the brain and heart (I told you it was poison!!). It can cause contact dermatitis in some people.</div>
