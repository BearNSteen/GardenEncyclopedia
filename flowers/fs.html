<h1>False Sunflower</h1><br>

<h3>Scientific Name: Heliopsis helianthoides</h3>
<h3>Information:</h3>
<div>[1] You can start false sunflowers by seed in either the spring or fall. For spring, start seeds indoors four to six weeks before your last frost date. In the fall, you can start seeds in flats or direct sow in mid- to late August. As perennials, they tend to begin blooming in their second year, so a spring seedling might not flower the year it's planted. However, seeds started in the fall should provide blooms the following summer.
This is a reliable repeat bloomer, and you should have flowers from summer into fall. Deadheading (removing spent blooms) will help to keep new buds forming and give the plant a tidier appearance. Plus, false sunflowers make lovely cut flowers and are very attractive to hummingbirds, bees, and butterflies.
False sunflowers are clump-forming and tend to stay in one place, rather than spreading throughout the garden. Dividing your plants every two to three years will keep the clumps from dying in the center. You can do this in either the spring or fall. Moreover, many varieties can get top-heavy and require staking. You also can prune or pinch them back in mid-spring for a shorter, sturdier plant. However, doing this will delay blooming for a couple of weeks.</div>
<h3>Dan's Notes</h3>
<div>These plants are a little strange to me. First of all, they produce a fruit, apparently, which has achenes (think of the small seed-looking things on the outside of strawberries). I have seen plenty of pictures of these flowers, but I haven't seen any kind of fruit that comes out of or off of it. Secondly, it has many other names, including "Benzinggold", "Light of Loddon" (which sound so fantasy and I love it), "Sonnenglut", "Spitzentaenzerin", and "Waterperry Gold". It has been found in a diverse number of places, including Saskatchewan, Newfoundland, Texas, and Georgia (and Pennsylvania, which is why it's in this encyclopedia).</div>
