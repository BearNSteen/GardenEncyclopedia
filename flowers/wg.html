<h1>Wild Ginger</h1><br>

<h3>Scientific Name: Asarum</h3>
<h3>Information:</h3>
<div>[1] Wild ginger favors moist, shaded sites with humus-rich soil. The deciduous, heart-shaped leaves are opposite, and borne from the rhizome which lies just under the soil surface. Two leaves emerge each year from the growing tip. The curious jug-shaped flowers, which give the plant an alternate name, little jug, are borne singly in spring between the leaf bases. Wild ginger can easily be grown in a shade garden, and makes an attractive groundcover.</div>
<h3>Dan's Notes</h3>
<div>There are a lot of different plants known as wild ginger, but for the sake of this project I will be referring to specifically "Asarum". The name is Latin, a plural word for altar or sanctuary. There is a big confusion about the taxonomy of this particular plant, which figures since there's tons of confusion surrounding which plant I refer to when I say "Wild Ginger". The Hexastylis are ten species of wild ginger distributed in North America, and the Asarum sensu stricto are 17 species also in North America. The rest are distributed exclusively in Asia.</div>
