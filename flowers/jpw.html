<img src="pics\jpw.png" width="200" height="200"></img><br>
<h3>Scientific Name: Eutrochium</h3>
<h3>Information:</h3>
<div>[1] Joe-pye weeds in the garden prefer full sun to partial shade. They also like to be kept somewhat moist in average to rich soil. Growing Joe-pye weed will even tolerate wet soil conditions but not overly dry sites. Therefore, in areas with hot, dry summers, plant these ornamental beauties in partially shaded locales. Spring or fall is the most suitable time for when to plant Joe-pye weed. Due to the large size of Joe-pye weed, it makes a great background plant but also needs plenty of room to grow. In fact, they are best planted on 24 inch (61 cm.) centers as they will eventually form large clumps. When growing Joe-pye weed in the garden, group it with similar woodland plants and ornamental grasses. For those that don’t have this wildflower presently growing on your property, you can usually find them in nurseries and garden centers. However, many of these Joe-pye weed plants are sold as E. maculatum. This type has more foliage and the flower heads as its wild counterpart. ‘Gateway’ is a popular cultivar for home gardens as it is a somewhat shorter variety.</div>
<h3>Dan's Notes</h3>
<div>These flowers, like many others in this encyclopedia, are members of the sunflower family. They are named after (surprise!) Joe Pye, who used these flowers for many medical conditions. Apparnelty he was a Mohican sachem (chief) named Schauquethqueat that took a Christian name after living in the mission town of Stockbridge, Massachusetts. Rumor says that he used them to cure fevers, while American colonists used it to treat typhus outbreaks. Native Americans supposedly used it in the treatment of kidney stones and urinary tract infections. </div>
