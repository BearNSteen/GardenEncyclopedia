<h3>Scientific Name: Geranium</h3>
<h3>Information:</h3>
<div>Geraniums may be grown as houseplants or as annual flowers. During the warmer months of the year (between your local frost dates), they can be kept outdoors in a sunny location. If keeping geraniums as houseplants, be sure to bring them indoors in late summer or early fall, when nighttime temperatures start to regularly dip below 55°F (13°C). When buying geraniums, pay close attention to color and size. Healthy leaves will have no discoloration on or below them and stems will be sturdy, not straggly. Be sure to avoid any plants with obvious signs of pests as well. Common houseplant pests include mealybugs, whiteflies, and spider mites. Place plants in pots with drainage holes to avoid root rot. Use a well-draining potting mixture (not heavy, clayey soil) when planting in containers. Geraniums do not like to sit in soggy, compacted soil. For maximum bloom, place the plants in an area where they will get 4-6 hours of sunlight.</div><br>
<div>Allow soil to dry to some extent between waterings, then water thoroughly. During the winter, water much less, but do not let the roots dry out entirely. Geraniums do best when given a period of dormancy through the winter months, during which they use less water and do not grow much. See below for more overwintering instructions. To encourage blooming, deadhead spent flowers regularly. To promote bushiness and curtail legginess, pinch back the stems. During active growing months, fertilize every 2 weeks or so. Use a water-soluble fertilizer at half strength. Don’t fertilize in winter, when the plant should be dormant. Geraniums can be re-potted in spring to encourage new growth—or if they look like they need to be refreshed.</div>
<h3>Dan's Notes</h3>
<div>Ohhh, Geraniums! See, I had no idea what a Cranesbill was, but now that I know it's just another name for a Geranium, it makes a bit more sense. Thanks to our good pal Carl Linnaeus, geraniums are the common names for two different plants. Thanks Carl! The ones I'm referring to are in the genus Geranium, as opposed to the genus Pelargonium, which are also called geraniums (ugh!). The other common name, Cranesbill, comes from the shape of the unsprung column, which in some species is long and looks like the bill of a crane. Sometimes, these plants are known as hardy geraniums to distinguish themselves from Pelargoniums, but not all Geraniums are winter hardy.</div>
