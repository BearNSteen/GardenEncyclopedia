<h3>Scientific Name: Symphyotrichum novae-angliae</h3>
<h3>Information:</h3>
<div>[1] New England Aster likes full or partial sun and may benefit from partial sun in the south.  It prefers moist to average water conditions but is drought tolerant once established.  In many conditions it will self-seed although is does not in our southern garden. This aster can be propagated with seed or division.  It is healthy for the plant to divide it every 2-3 years. The seeds need to be fall-planted for spring growth or cold-stratified for 60 days before planting in the spring.  They will take an additional 21-45 days to germinate once planted.  Plant New England Aster seeds on the soil surface and gently press into the soil.  Keep the seeds moist at a temperature around 65-75Â°F.</div>
<h3>Dan's Notes</h3>
<div>This flower has been used for various medicinal purposes. It has been used to treat skin eruptions, namely from poison ivy and poison sumac. A poultice has been made out of it for pain by the Cherokee, as well as an infusion of roots for diarrhea, an infusion of the plant for fever, and ooze of the roots for catrrh (inflamed airways or cavities of the body). Surprisingly, it has also been used to revive people, through smudging (burning) and fumigation.</div>
