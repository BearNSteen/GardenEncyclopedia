<h3>Scientific Name: Baptisia australis</h3>
<h3>Information:</h3>
<div>B. australis is the most commonly cultivated species in its genus, and is also cultivated beyond its native continent in other areas such as Great Britain, where it has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. It is considered to be a desirable plant in the garden due to its deep blue to violet spring flowers, the attractive light green compound leaves, and also for the somewhat unusual oblong fruits that emerge in the late summer. It grows best in lime-free, well-drained stony soil in full sun to part shade. It grows to about 90 to 120 cm (3.0 to 3.9 ft) tall in height with a similar spread. Like other members of the genus, it has a very deep taproot, which makes it quite difficult to move once planted. It thrives in full sun and requires water only in times of low rainfall. One slightly negative feature it that the leaves tend to drop early in the fall, but this may be avoided by cutting the dead stems as they die back. It is hardy in USDA zones 3 through 8. It is commonly employed as a border plant in gardens. While there are no commonly available cultivars, several hybrids involving B. australis have been created, such as 'Purple Smoke', which is a cross with Baptisia alba. The variety B. australis var. minor is also used occasionally in gardens. It is much shorter at only 30 to 60 cm (1 to 2 ft) in height, but the flowers are equal in size.</div>
<h3>Dan's Notes</h3>
<div>First of all, the name of the genus is derived from the Ancient Greek word bapto, meaning "to dip" or "immerse", which I love. Bapto is just such a silly and cool sounding word / noise combination. Anyways, unusually the only good source I could find on this plant was Wikipedia, which you just read if you have been reading this page and not just my notes (don't flatter yourself, Dan). The same Wikipeda page really gets gritty with the reproductive description it gives for this plant (something something, emerging erect and spreading your rhizomes) but I would like to mention that it apparently secretes a dark blue sap, which is super cool. Fun fact! The shoots of this plant have been mistaken for asparagus which resulted in some poisoned children. Someone needs to keep better track of their kids and their asparagus.</div>
