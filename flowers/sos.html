<h3>Dan's Notes</h3>
<div>This one is interesting. The cut roots supposedly look like Hebrew characters, hence the name. Polygonatum comes from the ancient Greek for "many knees", as its rhizome (stem) has multiple joints. Also, the roots "bear depressions that resemble royal seals" which is another reason for the name "Solomon's Seal". There are tons of species of this flower. Many are used as ornamental plants, and they have uses in the treatment of diabetes and hyperglycemia. It is used as an aphrodisiac, and can be used to treat pain, fever, inflammation, allergy, and weakness. Many species have been used in China for a long time. They have been cooked or used raw and served as a side dish with meat and rice.</div>
