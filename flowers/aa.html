<h1>Aromatic Aster</h1><br>

<h3>Scientific Name: Symphyotrichum oblongifolium</h3>
<h3>Information:</h3>
<div>[1]The native perennial Aromatic Aster is a very late bloomer, but it is worth the wait!  Blooming about two weeks after its cousin New England Aster blooms, it will prolong the color of your garden well into Autumn.  I’ve never seen a garden flower bloom later than Aromatic Aster.  It creates showy clusters of flowers that are generally low to the ground.  Since it blooms so late, Aromatic Aster is very valuable to pollinators, as it is one of the last sources of food before winter dormancy.  The ‘aromatic’ portion of the name refers to the leaves when crushed.  This plant is frost tolerant, and will be one of the latest blooming flowers you will ever see.  I’ve seen it bloom all the way into November in Pennsylvania. If you like to have year round color in your garden, then Aromatic Aster is a must-have.  The only real maintenance item for this plant is staking it if you don’t want it to flop over or pulling new volunteers.  Alternatively, you can surround it with taller plants, packed close together to provide support.  This plant will slowly spread via rhizome.  So, it will fill out an area over time.  The branching is pretty dense, making the plant appear to be a small shrub even if it falls over.  As the nearby picture shows, even if the plant has fallen over, it still makes a stunning display in the flower bed. Also, saving seed from Aster is a good idea, since in the wild an individual plant has been observed to live for a maximum of six years.</div>
<h3>Dan's Notes</h3>
<div>I think it's worth mentioning that this plant used to be called Aster oblongifolius. I originally had that marked down as the scientific name, but Wikipedia got mad at me and reigned me in. I'm not big on these, sort of, pastel plants? Lavender is not a very strong color for me. According to NatureServe, these plants are in critical condition in Colorado and North Carolina, "imperiled" in Wyoming, and vulnerable in Indiana and Ohio.</div>
