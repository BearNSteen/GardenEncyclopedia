<h3>Scientific Name: Liatrus</h3>
<h3>Information:</h3>
<div>[1] Although Liatris plant materials are sometimes marketed as bulbs, they are technically corms, and it’s hard to believe that any life can emerge from these woody little nuggets in a bag. However, these structurally swollen dormant stem parts will send up shoots followed by flowers approximately three months after a spring planting. As with all bulbous types of plants, the largest corms will produce the most impressive flowers, and you should look for corms that are at least 3 inches in diameter. Space the corms 12 to 15 inches apart, and plant them 2 to 4 inches deep.
Liatris takes very little care, but you may need to stake up the stems if they are planted in loose soil.
<b>Light</b>
Choose a site with full sun to plant your liatris corms.
<b>Soil</b>
Just about any soil, at any level of fertility, will successfully grow liatris corms, although quick drainage is essential to prevent rot. Liatris plants prefer a slightly acid to neutral soil pH.
<b>Water</b>
After planting, water the corms thoroughly. The corms need no additional irrigation before the plants emerge. One inch of water a week during the hottest months will prevent stunted flowers and leaf scorch. Apply water to the base of the plants, or use drip irrigation, to avoid spreading fungal diseases. These plants need more water in their first year; afterward, they have very good tolerance to drought and dry soil conditions.
<b>Temperature and Humidity</b>
Liatris is quite tolerant of the heat and humidity of summer weather in warm climates, but it may rot if left in wet soils over the winter.
<b>Fertilizer</b>
Liatris is not a heavy feeder, but if the soil fertility is poor you can apply a balanced flower fertilizer once a year, in the spring as active growth begins.
<b>Propagating Liatris</b>
It’s fun to get new plants for nothing by propagating them, and this is easy to do with liatris corms. Dig the plants up late in the fall after the first freeze has killed the stems, and you will notice tiny corms, called cormels, clinging to the “mother corm.” Pick off the cormels, gently wipe away the soil, and store them in a cool shed or garage until spring planting time.</div>
<h3>Dan's Notes</h3>
<div>Holy cow, there are a lot of species of this flower. Frankly, there are probably a lot of species of most of the flowers that I've written about, but I haven't seen a list this long before of how many there are, and this probably isn't all of them, either. Doing a quick once-over of the list, I can see that the one native to Pennsylvania is the Liatris pillosa, or grass-leaf blazing star (or shaggy blazing star). They are used as food for butterflies and moths, including flower moths and bleeding flower moths, in addition to schinia tertia and chinia trifacia, two other moths.</div>
