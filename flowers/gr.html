<h3>Dan's Notes</h3>
<div>This flower originally wasn't used much for medicinal purposes, as it causes liver veno-cclusive disease when it metabolizes. An easier way to describe the disease is small vein obstruction in the liver. However, it was apparently a popular and important treatment among the Native Americans for reproductive conditions. It was also known as Life Root to the Eclectics and used as a uterine tonic. It "exerts a specific influence upon the reproductive organs of the female" and "relieves irritation and strengthens functional activity." Unfortunate that it's called ragwort, as it sounds wholly disgusting, but it seems to have its uses.</div>
