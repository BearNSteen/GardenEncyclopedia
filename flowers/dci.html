<h3>Scientific Name: Iris cristata</h3>
<h3>Information:</h3>
<div>It prefers to grow in well-drained soils that are neutral or slightly acidic (pH level of 6.1 to 6.5). It also prefers medium to high fertile soils containing humus, although it will tolerate loamy soils. It can tolerate shade or full sun, but prefers cool, semi-shaded positions. It has average to above average water needs during the growing season. It becomes dormant in winter. It can be grown in a mixed flower border, or rock garden. It also can be naturalized within a woodland garden, creating ground-cover. It can also be grown on peat banks, with other acidic loving plants, including camellias and azaleas. It is normally recommended to add peat (or leaf-mould) and sharp sand (or grit) when planting new plants. The roots should be planted (during Spring or Summer or Autumn), so that the top of the rhizome is about 3â€“5 cm below the soil line. Once planted, they can be surrounded with leaf mulch, to help with moisture retention. They can suffer from damage by snails and slugs. They also can suffer damage from deer, but the plants can survive the nibbling, and flowers can also be eaten. Other minor threats include; Iris borer, verbena bud moth, whiteflies, iris weevil, thrips, aphids, and nematodes. Bacterial leaf blight and soft rot, crown rot, rhizome rot, leaf spot, rust, viruses, and scorch. Grown in ideal conditions, the plants can live for up to 10 years. Smaller, poorer and paler forms were originally mistakenly thought to be Iris lacustris. They can be found in plenty of reputable nurseries in the US, but it is rarely offered on sale in Europe.</div>
<h3>Dan's Notes</h3>
<div>This genus is named for the Greek goddess of the rainbow, according to [missouribotanicalgarden.org]. While that's correct, I think it's sort of misinformation to say that was her defining characteristic. Iris is the messenger of the gods, not to be confused with Hermes. She has a principle role in Homer's Iliad and Virgil's Aeneid. Anyways, if you aren't aware, irises are known for being poisonous. If injested, they can cause stomach pains and vomiting, while handling can cause skin irritation or allergic reactions. That being said, it has also been used as a medicinal plant that helps with ulcers and the liver. It's also a spice, which sound incredibly dangerous considering. Eat at your own risk!</div>
