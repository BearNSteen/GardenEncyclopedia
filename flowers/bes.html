<h1>Black-Eyed Susan</h1><br>
<img src="pics\bes.png" width="200" height="200"></img><br>
<h3>Scientific Name: Rudbeckia hirta</h3>
<h3>Information:</h3>
<div>Plant black-eyed Susans when the soil temperature has reached 70°F for best seed germination. In many parts of North America, the planting period is March to May. The flower will flower June to September. Germination takes 7 to 30 days. Plant seeds in moist, well-drained soil. These hearty flowers really enjoy the Sun. They prefer full sun, though they’ll grow in partial sun. Sow by seed in loosely covered soil. It’s best if soil is fertile (not poor) though they can tolerate tough conditions. Black-eyed Susans generally grow between 1 and 3 feet tall (though they can grow taller) and can spread between 12 to 18 inches, so plant seeds closer to prevent lots of spreading or plant further apart to make a nice border.</div><br>
<div>Check your plants regularly to see if they need watering. Make sure they don’t dry out. Divide perennial types every 3 to 4 years to ensure healthy plants and to prevent excessive spreading. Be sure to remove faded/dead flowers to prolong blooming. You can cut back black-eyed Susans after they flower and a second, smaller bloom may occur in late fall.</div>
<h3>Dan's Notes</h3>
<div>Oh no! What happened to Susan? "Jokes" aside (sorry Susan), this plant looks suspiciously like a sunflower to me, just without the fanfare. Wait - okay, I'm back. Turns out these are actually in the same family as sunflowers. In fact, they're in the same family as asters and daisies, too. But enough about its family, we're here to talk about Susan. This flower is the state flower of Maryland, but it's been found in all 48 states in the continental US and all 10 Canadian Provinces! (I hate to say it but I actually didn't know there were 10... maybe I need a geography app instead of a flower encyclopedia) These flowers are also good for attracting butterflies, and they're used by Native Americans in herbal medicine. But watch out! It's toxic to cats!</div>
