<h3>Dan's Notes</h3>
<div>These plants don't seem to have any medicinal uses, and they can only really be used sparingly in clumps to be sprinkled on rock gardens, apparently. They overgrow frequently and produce a vibrant show as they come in many pretty colors in a blue-purple range. Each plant produces four seeds within "wrinkled nuts" and then the plant goes dormant until the following spring.</div>
