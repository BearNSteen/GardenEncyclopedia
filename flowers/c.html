<h1>Columbine</h1><br>
<img src="pics\c.png" width="200" height="200"></img><br>
<h3>Scientific Name: Aquilegia</h3>
<h3>Information:</h3>
<div>Columbine grows in sun or light shade. Sow seeds indoors 6 to 8 weeks before the last expected frost or direct sow into prepared beds with rich, well-drained soil after the last spring frost. See local frost dates. Press the flower seed into the soil, but do not cover with soil. Thin to the strongest plants. If planting a container plant, dig a hole twice the diameter of the pot the plant is in. Place the plant in the hole so the top of the root ball is level with the soil surface. Fill in around the plant and firm the soil gently. Space mature plants 1 to 2 feet apart, depending on the variety. Water thoroughly. Do not overwater. Deadhead faded flowers and new buds will develop along the stems. The bloom season can be extended by as long as six weeks into mid summer. Cut back foliage to the ground in the fall. When the ground is frozen, mulch to protect plants.</div>
<h3>Dan's Notes</h3>
<div>This is the state flower of Colorado, which is somewhat unfortunate considering the emotions that the name carries in modern culture. On a more positive note, this flower is also called a granny's bonnet! It sort of looks like one, too. Apparently, it was used as a condiment by Native Americans, and are safe to consume in small quantities. Too bad, since I usually put way too much ketchup on the plate, I would probably end up poisoning myself with this. The seeds and roots are highly poisonous, and can cause severe gastroenteritis (infectious diarrhea) and heart palpitations if consumed! A condiment and highly toxic? I believe this plant is designed to kill me.</div>
