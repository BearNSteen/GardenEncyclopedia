<h3>Scientific Name: Eurybia divaricata</h3>
<h3>Information:</h3>
<div>[1] Plants grow 2-3’ tall with 2-4’ spread. The great advantage that Aster divaricatus offers is the ability to grow and flower in dry shade.  Flowering and form are best, however, in partly shaded sites where plants have 3 hours or so of sun. Plants tolerate average, dry or moist soil.  They self-seed to the point that some describe the plant as “weedy”.  This should not be an issue in a natural setting but in smaller gardens, dead-heading can limit seed production. Aster divaricatus is drought tolerant and somewhat unpalatable to deer and rabbits. To encourage density, plants can be cut back to 6” in late spring. </div>
<h3>Dan's Notes</h3>
<div>Recently, the Latin names of a number of Asters were changed due to DNA and genetic research findings. This particular aster used to be known as Aster divaricatus. Caterpillars really enjoy these plants, as they host the pearl crescent and checkerspot butterflies most frequently. White wood asters are known as one of the highest quality asters, according to the Chicago Botanic Garden's Plant Evaluation Program. They claim that "Top rated asters displayed consistently strong habits, superior flower production, excellent disease resistance and full winter hardiness throughout a six-year evaluation term."</div>
