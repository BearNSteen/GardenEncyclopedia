<h3>Scientific Name: Tiarella</h3>
<h3>Information:</h3>
<div>Tiarella are better for deep shade than their cousin heuchera but prefer the dappled sunlight found in woodland gardens. In deep shade their foliage color may fade. In North Carolina, a site with 3-5 hours of dappled sunlight per day is perfect. Foam flowers prefer the pH in soils to be close to neutral and in order to pair them with more acid lovers, we recommend a pH of 6.2 - 6.5 that will allow all plants to be grown equally well.    Tiarella are low maintenance plants and can remain undivided for years in the garden without losing vigor. If they become tattered looking due to weather extremes, they can be cut back for rejuvenation, but this is not necessary.   
The astringent Tiarella leaves are generally left alone by deer and rabbits, but remember that in the middle of the winter a ravenous deer or rapacious rabbit will eat anything, including Tiarella. Foam flowers are generally not affected by insect pests. Occasionally black vine weevils can infest the plant, boring into the crown and killing the tops. Black vine weevils are controlled by systemic insecticides but if untreated, they will eventually kill the plant. Gardeners may sometimes see mealy bugs or slugs but they are easily controlled with commercial products. Rarely, foliar nematodes will cause ugly discolored patches on the leaf. There is no control for nematodes...avoidance is the key. Buy plants only from nurseries that scout for and remove infected plants.
Tiarella grow quite well in shade garden containers. They like well drained potting mixes without a lot of fertilizer. Keep the pots well watered in the summer but do not over-water in the winter. The pots will need some protection from cold winter winds.</div>
<h3>Dan's Notes</h3>
<div>These flowers are known as foam flowers because they apparently look like foam on a stick. I guess that's a good enough reason to name it that? I was expecting a bit more. You can hybridize it with heuchera (alumroot, which is in this encyclopedia) to make "the intergeneric hybrid x heucherella", which sounds interesting to say the least. The name Tiarella comes from "tiara" (like a crown) and "-ella" (meaning "diminutive") to refer to the small dry fruit capsule the flower has. Interesting, considering how many flowers are named after explorers, that there is one simply named for what it looks like. Lots of tiny surprises with this flower.</div>
