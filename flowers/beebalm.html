<h3>Scientific Name: Monarda</h3>
<h3>Information:</h3>
<div>Bee balm can be planted in the spring or in the fall. It thrives in full sunshine; it can be grown in partial sun, but it won’t bloom as happily as it does in full sun. Given its height (2-4 feet), bee balm makes for an excellent background plant in a pollinator garden. Space plants 18-24 inches apart in rich, well-draining soil. It needs good air circulation, otherwise it can develop powdery mildew on its leaves. Water thoroughly at the time of planting. Keep soil evenly moist through the growing season. Add mulch around the plants to preserve the moisture in the soil and control weeds. Deadhead faded blooms to encourage the plant to re-bloom in late summer. After the first frost in the fall, cut stems back to about 2 inches above the soil. Divide bee balm every 2 to 3 years to ensure its vigor. In the spring make small divisions of the newer roots of established plants and replant.</div>
<h3>Dan's Notes</h3>
<div>This plant is in the same family as mint, and has several names, including "horsemint", "oswego tea" (what??), and "bergamot", not to be confused with bergamot orange. In fact, it was the leaves smelling like bergamot orange that caused this plant to be referred to as such. Despite that, the genus is actually named after Spanish botanist Nicolás Monardes, who wrote a book in 1574 describing plants of the New World. It would also appear that aspects of this plant are very useful in dental care, mostly the antiseptic compound thymol which is found in modern commercial mouthwash. There's a lot going on with this plant, but, we all know the most important part is whether it looks pretty. And it does! So go grow your mouthwash plants to your heart's content.</div>
