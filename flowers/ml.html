<h3>Scientific Name: Lilium michiganense</h3>
<h3>Information:</h3>
<div>[1] It is an easy-to-grow Lily, typically growing to 2-5' tall, but can grow to 6 or 7 feet under ideal conditions. Stems arise from a scaly bulb. In June and July, the stems are topped with 1-3 bright orange-red pendant Turk's cap-type flowers, to 3" wide, changing to yellow with orange-brown spots near the center. As the bulbs grow larger, each stalk may produce up to five flowers. Plants in cultivation can also have many more than 5 flowers terminating the stem. Leaves average less than 6 inches long, are elliptic to lance-shaped and occur in whorls along the stem. Hardiness zones 4-8, (-32째C/-25째F, -10째C/15째F) in Winter. Grow on in full sun to dappled shade in any good garden soil with adequate drainage. Prefers an acidic, moist, well-drained soil such as a sand-peat moss-loam mix with a gravelly bottom. Water regularly; do not overwater. It can be found mostly in slightly dry, sunny areas.</div>
<h3>Dan's Notes</h3>
<div>These flowers named after states always confuse me, although this one is named quite literally even with its scientific name. The flower can be found anywhere from the Great Lakes to New York, in the latter where it is endangered in addition to in Tennessee. It is often confused with the Turk's cap lily and the asian "tiger lily". I could not find any medicinal uses for this flower, though there are lots articles talking about avoiding confusing it with the Turk's cap lily.</div>
