<h3>Scientific Name: Actaea racemosa</h3>
<h3>Also known as: Black Cohosh</h3>
<h3>Information:</h3>
<div>Black cohosh prefers a rich, moist, soil that is high in organic matter. In its natural habitat, it is usually found in shaded or partially shaded areas, although it will grow in full sun. Black cohosh can be grown successfully in raised beds in the woods (referred to as "woods cultivated"), in raised beds under an artificial shade structure (referred to as "shade grown"), or in a low-density, low-input method mimicking how it grows in the wild (referred to as "wild simulated"). Regardless of the cultivation system used, it is important to choose a site with well-drained, but moist, soil. Black cohosh has been known to tolerate more light and soil variations than ginseng or goldenseal, provided there is adequate moisture available. Raised beds are highly recommended, especially for clay soils or areas that tend to stay wet after a heavy rain. Make sure sufficient compost or other organic material is added to raise the organic matter content of the soil. Soils with pH of 5 to 6 are ideal for growing black cohosh.</div><br>
<div>If an open field is used for production, until the influence of full-sun on plant growth and root quality is determined, it is recommended that a shade structure be erected. Typically, a wood lath structure or polypropylene shade structure is used. Build the structure seven feet tall or higher with two opposite ends open to the prevailing breeze. For woods cultivated or wild simulated production, select a site shaded by tall, hardwood trees or a mix of hardwood and pine trees. Look for a site where other woodland plants grow such as mayapple, trillium, bloodroot, ginseng, or a native stand of black cohosh.</div>
<h3>Dan's Notes</h3>
<div>Looks like this plant has been facing some confusion for a while. The original taxonomic placer, Carl Linnaeus, placed this plant into the genus Actaea, but later Thomas Nuttall reclassified it into the genus Cimicifuga. Even later, research deemed that this plant was indeed more closely related to Actaea than Cimicifuga. The plant is called Bugbane because it has a "mildly unpleasant, medicinal smell". It's popular because it stays "handsome" for many weeks. I'm not sure what staying handsome is supposed to mean, Wikipedia. I googled "plant staying handsome" and got some really questionably handsome cartoon plants. Perhaps this plant turns into a reasonably handsome cartoon plant. If so, plant at your own risk.</div>
