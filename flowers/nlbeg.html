Light Requirement: Sun, Part Shade
Soil Moisture: Moist, Wet
CaCO3 Tolerance: Low

<h3>Dan's Notes</h3>
<div>Native Americans have used tea made from the root of this plant to cure diarrhea in children, and for worms and stomachaches. Several species have been used for laxatives. Sisyrinchion is a Greek word derived from sus (pig) and rhynchos (nose) because pigs grub the roots. Goldblatt and Manning, two plant researchers, claim that the naming was arbitrary. On top of this, the taxonomy is very confusing because variants of this flower are named as other species of Sisyrinchium instead of variants. Altogether, this genus is just confusing.</div>
