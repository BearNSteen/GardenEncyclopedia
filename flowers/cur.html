<h1>Culver's Root</h1><br>
<img src="pics\cur.png" width="200" height="200"></img><br>
<h3>Scientific Name: Veronicastrum virginicum</h3>
<h3>Information:</h3>
<div>The stems are hairless and usually unbranched. The leaves are serrated and arranged in whorls of 3-7 around the stem. The inflorescence is erect with slender and spike-like racemes to about 9 in (23 cm) long, giving the flower cluster a candelabra-like appearance. The stamens are crowded and protrude in a brush-like fashion perpendicular to the raceme. The corollas are white and are roughly 2mm in length. These plants flower for about a month from mid-June to late August, depending on the latitude. Culver's root is frequently found in wet to wet-mesic prairies and sometimes moist upland sites. It is also found in a good number of prairie or native meadow restorations.</div>
<h3>Dan's Notes</h3>
<div>This plant is so strange to me. It's in the plantain family, which I have just discovered is not the same family that bananas come from. Did you know that a banana is actually a berry? Who knew! Anyways, this plant is a perennial. Its name means "of Virginia", which actually refers to the eastern US and eastern Canada, not just Virginia. Culver's Root is named as such for Dr. Culver who was "a pioneer physician of the 18th century and used its bitter roots for purgative purposes". Despite that, I can't find any information as for what "purgative purposes" actually means. It sounds really sinister, if you ask me, so maybe you should stay away from Culver's Root.</div>
