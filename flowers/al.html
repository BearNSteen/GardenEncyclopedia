<h1>Alumroot (Coral Bells)</h1><br>

<h3>Scientific Name: Heuchera</h3>
<h3>Information:</h3>
<div>[1] Coral bells plants prefer partial shade but can take more sun in cold climates. Give them well-drained, moist, rich soil that’s neutral to slightly acidic, with a pH of 6.0 to 7.0. Some species, like H. sanguinea, don't tolerate clayey or acidic soils. Other than keeping them regularly watered during their first year of growth, heucheras don’t require much care. Divide heuchera clumps as needed, or every three or four years. Deadhead the flowers, to promote more blooms, which may continue into summer. After the flowers are finished, simply cut off the stalks to help the plant put more energy into leaf production. If you wish, prune the foliage back in early spring, so new growth won’t be crowded.</div>
<h3>Dan's Notes</h3>
<div>HGTV deems these to be "deer-resistant beauties". I personally have a huge problem with deers eating our plants. (Okay, my fiancee has a huge problem, let's be real, it isn't me doing the gardening, which you should know if you read these!) Maybe these would be a good idea for us? Some of the colors (namely "Cinnamon Swirls", which is a great name) look very pretty, possibly giving these a nice autumn vibe. They grow in the shade in the mid-Atlantic, but they also grow pretty well in California, so Heuchera is a very diverse genus. Fun fact: They're named after a German physician, Johann Heinrich von Heucher.</div>
