<h3>Scientific Name: Polemonium</h3>
<h3>Information:</h3>
<div>[1] The Jacob’s ladder plant is a woodland perennial that prefers a shady to semi-shady spot for growing. Jacob’s ladder leaves tend to scorch with too much heat or sun. It grows best in soils that are rich in organic materials and likes a moist, but not soggy environment. That being said, one of the pleasures of this garden addition is that it tolerates drought once its root system is firmly entrenched. It is also deer resistant and isn’t prone to disease or insect infestation. Nothing is easier than how to grow and plant Jacob’s ladder. Once you’ve located a spot suitable to their needs, there are two methods of propagation: by seed or by plant division. Seeds – Cultivars won’t always breed true from seed, but if you’re not concerned with specific colors, seeds (either purchased or self-sown) can yield some interesting results. Sow the tiny brown seeds directly into the soil in spring after all danger of frost has passed. Loosely cover the seeds with a fine sprinkling of soil, water gently and keep moist until seedlings sprout. The seeds will germinate quickly and should be thinned to about 18 inches (46 cm.) apart. You’ll get a fine showing of foliage the first year, but may not see flowers until the second season. Divisions – For the best results and care of Jacob’s ladder, divisions should be made in the early spring just as new growth appears. Carefully dig the entire plant from the ground. Separate the basal rosettes by tearing apart the roots and replant each of the resulting Jacob’s ladder plants in its new spot. This is also a great time to replenish that area of the garden with rich, organic soil. Water your transplants well and keep the ground moist for a few weeks to give the plant’s roots time to settle into their new home.</div>
<h3>Dan's Notes</h3>
<div>As you are probably aware, the name of these flowers comes from the biblical story where it is a ladder leading to heaven in a dream in the Book of Genesis. Like other plants in this list, there are an insane amount of flowers in the genus, and it is unclear which is native to Pennsylvania. What is known is that they are usually in cold temperatures and at high altitudes. They are perennials, and are commonly eaten by butterflies.</div>
