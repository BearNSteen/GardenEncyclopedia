<h1>Swamp Sunflower</h1><br>

<h3>Scientific Name: Helianthus angustifolius</h3>
<h3>Information:</h3>
<div>[1] Swamp sunflower plants are available at most garden centers and nurseries. You can also plant seeds directly in the garden or propagate swamp sunflower by dividing a mature plant. Although swamp sunflower tolerates boggy soil, it spreads rapidly when grown in moist, well-drained soil. The plant tolerates light shade but prefers full sunlight. Too much shade may result in a weak, leggy plant with few blooms. Provide plenty of space; each plant can spread to a width of 4 to 5 feet. Once established, swamp sunflowers in the garden require little maintenance, so your swamp sunflower care will be minimal. The adaptable plant tolerates dry soil for short periods but will do best if you provide water whenever the soil feels dry. A 2-3 inch layer of mulch will help keep the soil cool and moist, but don’t let the mulch pile up against the stems. Trim the plant by one-third in early summer to produce a bushy, prolific plant. Remove faded blooms before they go to seed if you don’t want volunteers, as the plant can be invasive in some areas.</div>
<h3>Dan's Notes</h3>
<div>I like that, without any knowledge of this plant, I would've told you that it was a sunflower knockoff in a swamp, judging by the picture. That aside, it is known for its showy yellow flowers (as you would expect from a sunflower) and it is found in all coastal states, from Texas to Long Island. It is also known as a narrowleaf sunflower. </div>
