<h1>Slender Mountain Mint</h1><br>
<img src="pics\smm.png" width="200" height="200"></img><br>
<h3>Scientific Name: Pycnanthemum tenuifolium</h3>
<h3>Information:</h3>
<div>The preference is full sun and moist to slightly dry conditions. This plant often grows in rich loam, as well as soil containing rocky or gravelly material. Foliar disease is less troublesome for this mint species than many others. The leaves may assume a yellowish appearance during a major drought. The flowers are very attractive to many kinds of insects, including long-tongued bees, short-tongued bees, wasps, flies, butterflies, skippers, beetles, and plant bugs. These insects usually seek nectar. Among the wasps, are such visitors as Thread-Waisted wasps, Bee Wolves (Philanthus spp.), Scoliid wasps, Tiphiid wasps, Sand wasps, Spider wasps, and Eumenine wasps. Flies visitors include Soldier flies, Syrphid flies, Mydas flies, bee flies, Thick-Headed flies, and Tachinid flies. The seeds are too small to be of much interest to birds. Mammalian herbivores usually don't browse on this plant because of the minty taste; the foliage may contain anti-bacterial substances that disrupt the digestive process of herbivores.</div>
<h3>Dan's Notes</h3>
<div>Apparently, the relationships within this genus are a big mystery. These plants can be crushed like most mints to a minty or thyme-like aroma. 19 of the species in Pycnanthemum are found in the Eastern US and Canada while one disjunct species is found in California and Oregon. Honestly, there isn't too much to say about this plant. It's minty and it's found in the mountains, so go ahead and crush some up if you find some.</div>
