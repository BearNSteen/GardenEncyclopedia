<h1>Great Blue Lobelia</h1><br>

<h3>Scientific Name: Lobelia siphilitica</h3>
<h3>Information:</h3>
<div>[1] Lobelia siphilitica prospers in shaded to partly sunny exposures with moist humus rich soil.  Plants tolerate sunny sites if sufficient moisture is present. The species adapts to sandy loam and gravelly or clay soil and acid to neutral pH.  Moisture is appreciated but this species is reported to be more drought tolerant than Lobelia cardinalis. After seed are produced, the flowering stem and roots die.  New offsets soon form and generate roots.  The small offsets are vulnerable in fall and winter so care should be taken not to bury them under thick mulch. This species is considered to be a short lived perennial but in an appropriate setting it will self-sow and replenish the population. Foliage is unpalatable to deer and other herbivores but is chewed by snails and slugs.</div>
<h3>Dan's Notes</h3>
<div>These flowers must be pollinated by bumblebees, as they cannot offer pollen to themselves. I was personally unaware that flowers could offer pollen to themselves in the first place, but, now I know, I suppose. It is a member of the bellflower family, Campanulaceae, which includes some medicinal and edible plants, though this is not one of either of those. This plant actually contains toxic alkaloids, which cause deer and other herbivores to avoid it. It also has larger flowers than most other blue Lobelia plants, hence the name.</div>
