<h3>Dan's Notes</h3>
<div>These are the eastern US version of the showy goldenrod, though there is another showy goldenrod that is also specific to the eastern United States (Solidago speciosa), so I will give some facts about goldenrods in general. Some goldenrods have been used for food, and are definitely edible. There are herbal teas that are made from goldenrod, as well. It is said to cure hay fever, and are often a sign of good luck, but many are also considered weeds and invasive. They are a popular food for butterflies (source: there is literally a page on Wikipeda dedicated to all the different kinds of butterflies that eat goldenrods, link below) and they are also used for creating rubber. It seems like a very diverse plant!</div>
