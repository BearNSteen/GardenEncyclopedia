<h3>Scientific Name: Penstemon Digitalis</h3>
<h3>Information:</h3>
<div>Also known as Penstemons, Beardtongues are usually bought as plants, but can be grown from seeds as well. Seed names include 'White Bedder', 'Andenken an Friedrich Hahn', 'Schoenholzeri', 'Hidcote Pink', 'Raven', 'Pensham Laura', 'Pensham Czar', and 'Pensham Amelia Jane'. They are ideal for mixed plantings in large containers, where they provide height and contrast to bushy and trailing summer plants. They are usually bought as small plants in spring or mature plants in bloom in summer. They should last several years before they need replacing, and oranically enriched potting mix can help them live for longer. Pinch out the tips of young plants so that they bush out first before starting to bloom. They grow quickly and need plenty of water and feeding. They open over many weeks; when they have all faded, cut off the steam back to a pair of leaves so that new shoots replace them. Toward fall, some lower leaves will turn brown and may need to be removed. They can be susceptible to extreme cold, so cover them with fleece in the dead of winter. Cuttings of nonflowering shoots root easily, so cut some off in late summer. In spring, cut back mature plants to keep them neat and promote new growth.</div>
<h3>Dan's Notes</h3>
<div>The colors are pretty on this one. I wonder what they were thinking when they named it? Wait - okay, I'm back after doing some Google searches. Nobody knows! It seems like everyone was content with calling them Penstemons. The first description of them was posted in 1748 in which John Mitchell named the flowers "Penstemons". Even the plant encyclopedia book that I have calls them Penstemons. So why are they called Beardtongues? The Wikipedia article even says "Penstemons, the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 250 species". This is information I would like to have, but alas, I do not. It does make it easy to remember them, though. Beard Tongues. What a visual.</div>
