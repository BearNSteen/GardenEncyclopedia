<h3>Scientific Name: Chrysogonum virginianum</h3>
<h3>Information:</h3>
<div>[1] Light Requirement: Part Shade
Soil Moisture: Moist
Soil pH: Acidic (pH less than 6.8)
Soil Description: Moist, but well-drained, to drier soils.
Conditions Comments: Can be used as a ground cover if thickly planted. Some varieties will spread very rapidly from seeds, stolons, runners and expansion of the clumps. Blooms sporadically over a long period; peak bloom period is in May. Plants seems to grow better if neglected than if pampered. Seems to benefit from being divided or transplanted at least every other year. Very adaptable (though will not stand full shade), tolerating both flood and drought.</div>
<h3>Dan's Notes</h3>
<div>The common name for this flower is "golden knee". The genus name comes from greek for "gold" (chrysos) and "joint" (gonu) in reference to the location of the flower stems. It's a member of the sunflower family, which explains why it looks kind of like a sunflower. There isn't a whole lot of interesting information about this flower, honestly. It doesn't seem like anyone uses it for anything other than a ground cover.</div>
