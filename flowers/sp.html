<h3>Scientific Name: Phlox paniculata</h3>
<h3>Information:</h3>
<div>[1] Set out new garden phlox plants in early spring. Choose a sunny location with moist but well-draining soil. Work some compost into the soil before planting if your soil doesn’t manage water well. Give the plants plenty of room, especially in hot, humid areas where air circulation around the plant will help keep powdery mildew to a minimum. Use the recommended spacing on the plant tag, which is usually 18 to 24 inches (46 to 61 cm.). Fertilize with a shovelful of compost for each plant or a light application of 10-10-10 fertilizer at planting time and again just before the flowers open. If you fertilize once more after the flowers fade, you may get another flush of flowers. Water garden phlox plants weekly for the first few weeks and often enough to keep the soil lightly moist thereafter. Keep the foliage as dry as possible by applying the water to the soil rather than the foliage. Spread a 2- to 3-inch (5 to 7.5 cm.) layer of mulch around the plants to help the soil hold moisture. Care of garden phlox also includes the clipping of flower stems after the flowers fade. This keeps the plants looking tidy, and also prevents the flowers from dropping seeds. Since garden phlox plants are generally hybrids, the seedlings that result from dropped seeds won’t resemble the parent plants.</div>
