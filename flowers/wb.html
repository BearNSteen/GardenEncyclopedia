<h3>Scientific Name: Monarda fistulosa</h3>
<h3>Information:</h3>
<div>[1] Feel free to plant your wild bergamot either in the spring or the fall. Although this hardy plant can grow in areas that are less than ideal, it prefers full sun and rich, well-draining soil. Wild bergamot does require a spot with plenty of air circulation to prevent powdery mildew. Space plants between 18 and 24 inches apart. After planting, water thoroughly, whether you’re starting with seeds, divided rhizomes, or cuttings. Once wild bergamot is planted, water regularly to keep the soil it grows in evenly moist. To help soil retain water and prevent the infiltration of weeds, you can mulch around wild bergamot plants. Deadhead spent flowers from your wild bergamot plants. Removing the blossoms once they’re expended doesn’t just keep plants looking attractive—it helps keep the entire plant healthy because resources are no longer wasted on parts whose time has come to an end. When you notice that leaves near the bottom of the plant are going yellow, cutting the stems down to three or four inches from the ground can actually get you a second blooming period. You should also do this pruning after the first frost in the fall.</div>
