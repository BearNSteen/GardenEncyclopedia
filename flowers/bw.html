<h3>Scientific Name: Asclepias tuberosa</h3>
<h3>Information:</h3>
<div>Beloved for its ability to attract a variety of helpful (and beautiful) insects to the garden, Butterly Weed is an easy-to-nurture varietal that can also be found growing as a native wildflower in a slew of untamed environments, like meadows, prairies, and forests. Typically grown from seeds you sow directly in the garden in the fall, the butterfly plant does not require much tending to in order to thrive, prospering well in everything from clay soil, to dry or rocky soil, and even throughout drought-like conditions. Its seed pods will brown towards the end of its growing season (early autumn) and, if left on the plant, will burst and spread seeds throughout your garden to emerge as new growth the following spring. While the plant can take up to three years to fully mature and produce flowers, its blooms will gradually grow denser with each season that passes. Choose a spot in your garden to plant your Butterfly Weed that boasts hours of bright sunlight daily, as this plant loves to soak up the rays. Full-sun is definitely your best bet, but the hardy plant can tolerate a few hours of shade too. Chances are there are more finicky flowers in your garden than the Butterfly Weed, so feel free to allow them to dictate the soil composition—when it comes to this plant, you don't have to stress. Butterfly Weed can prosper in a variety of soil conditions and compositions, from clay to gravel, and generally prefers a neutral to slightly acidic pH. During its first year of life (or until new plants start showing mature growth), you should maintain a moist soil environment for the Butterfly Weed. Once the plant appears to be well-established, you can cut back to watering it only occasionally, as it now prefers dry soil. Because the Butterfly Weed is adaptable to zones three through nine, it can thrive in a variety of different temperature and humidity settings. Generally, the plant emerges in late spring, hitting its peak bloom during the warmer summer months and drying on the stem throughout the autumn and winter. It also tolerates heat and drought well. The low maintenance Butterfly Weed does not require any additional fertilization—in fact, doing so can harm the plant, so it's best to just let it do its thing.</div>
<h3>Dan's Notes</h3>
<div>Milkweed! Butterfly weed is such a strange name, and it probably gives off a very particular image in modern times. Considering that it's known for attracting butterflies to your yard, I guess you could actually say the butterfly weed is an appropriate name, whether in the modern context or when weed refers to it being in your garden. (I'm not going to specify what I'm talking about. If you don't know, you aren't the intended audience, and you should go on with your life.) Here's something important! This plant is toxic! It contains glycosides, alkaloids, and resinoids that can cause weakness, seizures, and corneal injuries. Despite that, the Native Americans and European pioneers used this to treat diarrhea. Go figure.</div>
