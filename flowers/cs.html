<h1>Common Sneezeweed</h1><br>
<img src="pics\cs.png" width="200" height="200"></img><br>
<h3>Scientific Name: Centipeda cunninghamii</h3>
<h3>Information:</h3>
<div>Sneezeweed plants (Helenium autumnale) produce pretty little daisy-like flowers, sometimes in shades of pale yellow and sometimes in rich, autumn shades such as gold and reddish brown. The flowers cover 3 to 5 foot (0.9-1.5 m.) tall mounds of foliage for about three months in the fall.
Use sneezeweed to extend the life of your garden well past the first fall frosts. The plants look best in a cottage garden setting. When growing sneezeweed plants in traditional borders, youâ€™ll have to prune and stake them to keep the plants well-behaved. Sneezeweed is ideal for prairies, meadows, and naturalized areas. Use them in the moist to wet soils along bodies of water. You may find sneezeweed wildflowers growing naturally around ponds and along drainage ditches. Clumps of sneezeweed make excellent additions to wildlife gardens where they help support insect populations. The Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation recommends planting sneezeweed to help support bees. The flowers are also known to attract butterflies.

<h3>Dan's Notes</h3>
<div>I don't like the name of this flower, but I also really don't like centipedes. The second name of this plant is named after Allan Cunningham, an English botanist and explorer, who was the author of Florae Insularum Novae Zelandiae Precursor in 1840 (what a mouthful). The first name is greek for one hundred feet, which is something you'd know if you also hate centipedes. It's a perennial (by the way, if you don't know what a perennial is, it's a plant that lives more than two years) and it's in the Daisy family. It has been used for treating wounds, infections, and inflamations. That doesn't save it from being awful sounding, though. I think I'll stick with sneezeweed instead of... centipeda...</div>
